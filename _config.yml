  This is an awesome description for the site. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. This appears in the document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description. And apparently in the footer.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
